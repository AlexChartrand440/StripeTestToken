Use this to quickly create Stripe test tokens for successful and exceptional responses from Stripe.

## Install
```bash
composer require jacobbennett/stripe-test-token
```

## Usage
```php
<?php

use JacobBennett\StripeTestToken;
use Stripe\Charge;

StripeTestToken::setApiKey('your_stripe_secret_test_key');

// Fake a Successful Charge

Charge::create([
        'amount' => 500,
        'curreny' => 'usd',
        'source' => StripeTestToken::validVisa(),
]);


// Fake a Failing Charge

try {

        Charge::create([
                'amount' => 500,
                'curreny' => 'usd',
                'source' => StripeTestToken::cvcFail(),
        ]);

} catch (\Stripe\Error\Card $e) {
        // handle errors
}

```

> Find full descriptions at original [Stripe Docs Reference](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards)

### Using Methods

To use any of the methods below, call the listed method as a static on the `StripeTestToken` class. If you only want to return the corresponding card number, such as with Selenium or Laravel Dusk, you can call the same method on the `StripeCardNumber` class.

```php
<?php 

\JacobBennett\StripeCardNumber::validVisa(); // Returns the valid Visa card number 4012888888881881
\JacobBennett\StripeTestToken::validVisa(); // Attempts to generate a token against the Stripe API for a valid Visa card
```

### Test card numbers
Genuine card information cannot be used in test mode. Instead, use any of the following test card methods to create a successful payment token:

| Method |
| --- |
| validVisa |
| validVisaDebit |
| validMastercard |
| validMastercardDebit |
| validMastercardPrepaid |
| validAmex |
| validDiscover |
| validDinersClub |
| validJCB |

### Testing for specific responses and errors

The following methods can be used to create tokens that produce specific responsesâ€”useful for testing different scenarios and error codes. Verification checks only run when the required information is provided (e.g., for `cvc_check` to fail, a CVC code must be provided).

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| successDirectToBalance | Charge succeeds and funds will be added directly to your available balance (bypassing your pending balance). |
| addressZipFail | The `address_line1_check` and `address_zip_check` verifications fail. If your account is [blocking payments that fail ZIP code validation](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/rules#traditional-bank-checks), the charge is declined. |
| addressFail | Charge succeeds but the `address_line1_check` verification fails. |
| zipFail | The `address_zip_check` verification fails. If your account is [blocking payments that fail ZIP code validation](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/rules#traditional-bank-checks), the charge is declined. |
| addressZipUnavailable | Charge succeeds but the `address_zip_check` and `address_line1_check` verifications are both unavailable. |
| cvcFail | If a CVC number is provided, the `cvc_check` fails. If your account is [blocking payments that fail CVC code validation](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/rules#traditional-bank-checks), the charge is declined. |
| customerChargeFail | Attaching this card to a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customer_object) object succeeds, but attempts to charge the customer fail. |
| successWithReview | Charge succeeds with a `risk_level` of elevated and [placed into review](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/review). |
| declineCard | Charge is declined with a `card_declined` code. |
| declineFraudulentCard | Charge is declined with a `card_declined` code and a `fraudulent` reason. |
| declineIncorrectCvc | Charge is declined with an `incorrect_cvc` code. |
| declineExpiredCard | Charge is declined with an `expired_card` code. |
| declineProcessingError | Charge is declined with a `processing_error` code. |
| declineIncorrectNumber | Charge is declined with an `incorrect_number` code as the card number fails the [Luhn check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). |

## Testing

In order to run the full test suite, you must have `STRIPE_KEY` set in your environment, as the test will hit the Stripe API in order to generate a test token.

```
$ STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_YourTestKeyHere phpunit tests/
```
